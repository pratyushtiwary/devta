## How to add a new component

Following are the steps to add a new component:

1. Create new folder inside `src/pages`.
2. Add a route to your component in `src/router/router.js`.
3. Add an option to the settings sidebar on `src/components/sidebar/sidebarLists.js`

## How to work on an existing component

Following are the steps to work on an existing component.

1. Go to `src/{component_name}/index`
2. You can find the name of the component in `src/router/routes.js` or you can find it on the site itself.
3. Reusable components are present in `src/components` and the utility functions are present in `src/components/utils`.

## Good practices

Please keep this in mind when making a contribution

- Since this project doesn't have any definitive style guide due to the nature of the components, try to use similar components as a reference or reach out to the contributors if you face any issue.
- Please make use of the reusable components at `src/components` wherever applicable.
- Please make sure to name the directory the same name of your route but in camel case.
